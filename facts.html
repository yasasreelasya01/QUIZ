            1.HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 as a markup language for structuring web pages.<BR>
            2.The first version of HTML was called HTML 2.0 and it included features like tables, forms, and basic formatting.<br>
            3.HTML5, the latest version of HTML, was released in 2014. It introduced new semantic elements, audio <br>and video support, canvas for graphics, and improved form handling.<br>
            4.HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language used for describing the structure of web content.<br>
            5.CSS can be used to create stunning text effects, such as gradient text, animated text, and even 3D text.<br>
            6.CSS has a feature called media queries that allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the <br>device or screen size, enabling responsive designs.<br>
            
            7.CSS can be used to create complex and intricate shapes, such as polygons, circles, and even custom shapes<br> using the CSS clip-path property.<br>

            9.CSS filters enable you to apply visual effects to elements, such as blur, brightness, contrast, and even grayscale<br> or sepia tones.<br>
